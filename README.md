# unit-4-game

The crystal collector game is a project written with JQuery. The game's instructions are: 

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.

The Javascript was written with Pseudocode first to make sense of the process. If you read the pseudocode, they are written as notes above the Jquery code.
